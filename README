This is an iOS Category to shorten your long URLS.

First drag the NSString + URLShorten.h and the NSString + URLShorten.m files into your project.
Then import them using this line of code #import "NSString + URLShorten.h"

The shorten your url by using 
NSString *shortenedurl = [@"http://www.google.com" shortenURL];
instead of http://www.google.com use a NSString.  ShortenedURL is the shortened url for your nsstring!

Thanks
